    description: BCC_CSM1.1 is the version 1.1 of the Beijing Climate Center Climate System
                Model (BCC_CSM1.1) developed at the Beijing Climate Center (BCC), 
                China Meteorological Administration (CMA), based on NCAR CCSM2.0.1. 
                It is a fully coupled global climateâ€“carbon model including interactive vegetation 
                and global carbon cycle, in which the atmospheric component BCC_AGCM2.1, ocean 
                component MOM4-L40, land component BCC_AVIM1.0, and sea ice component 
                SIS are fully coupled and interact with each other through fluxes of momentum, 
                energy, water and carbon at their interfaces. Information between the atmosphere 
                and the ocean is exchanged once per simulated day. The exchange of atmospheric 
                carbon with the land biosphere is calculated at each model time step (20 min). Further
                details can be referred to Wu et al. (2012a; 2012b).
