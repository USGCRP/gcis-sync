    description :
        The B2 storyline and scenario family describes a world in which the
        emphasis is on local solutions to economic, social and environmental
        sustainability. It is a world with continuously increasing global
        population, at a rate lower than A2, intermediate levels of economic
        development, and less rapid and more diverse technological change than
        in the A1 and B1 storylines. While the scenario is also oriented towards
        environmental protection and social equity, it focuses on local and
        regional levels.
