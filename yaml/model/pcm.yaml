        This is a joint effort to develop a DOE-sponsored parallel climate model
        between Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), the Naval Postgraduate
        School (NPG), the US Army Corps of Engineers' Cold Regions Research
        and Engineering Lab (CRREL) and the National Center for Atmospheric
        Research (NCAR). We have coupled the NCAR Community Climate Model
        version 3, the LANL Parallel Ocean Program, and a sea ice model from
        the Naval Postgraduate School together in a massively parallel computer
        environment. This is Version 1 of the PCM (PCM1).
