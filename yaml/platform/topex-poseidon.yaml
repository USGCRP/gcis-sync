         TOPEX/Poseidon (or simply T/P) is a cooperative Earth observation mission
         of the USA and France (NASA/JPL and CNES as partners) with the overall
         objective to provide high-accuracy global sea level (ocean height)
         measurements in coordinates relative to the center of the Earth. From
         this information, ocean circulation patterns can be mapped. The T/P data
         analysis helps to understand how the oceans interact with the atmosphere,
         and improve our ability to predict the global climate. NASA provided
         the satellite bus, five instruments, and is responsible for spacecraft
         operations. CNES furnished two of the spacecraft's instruments and the
         mission's Ariane launch vehicle.

        name : Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite
        description : >
            The DORIS tracking system is a new development by the French organizations:
            CNES (Centre National D'Etudes Spatiales), GRGS (Groupe de Recherches de
            Géodésie Spatiale), and IGN (Institut Géographique National). DORIS is a
            one-way microwave tracking system for the determination of precise orbits
            (3-10 cm radial distance and 0.3 mm/s in range rate accuracy). The
            concept is based on a ground segment (of globally positioned tracking
            stations) and a space segment (i.e. DORIS as a passenger payload in a
            satellite consisting of a receiver, an ultra-stable oscillator, and an
            antenna). There is also a control center as part of the ground segment,
            located at CNES.

        name : Laser Reflector Array
        description : >
            This passive sensor of JPL is used by a ground laser network (of 10-15
            SLR stations) to track the position of the satellite for precision orbit
            determination (verification of altitude measurements). The mass of LRA
            is 29 kg; the LRA accuracy depends on laser station characteristics. The
            LRA is used to calibrate the other location systems on the satellite
            (DORIS, GPSDR) with a very high degree of precision.

            SSALT is also referred to as Poseidon-1. The single instrument frequency
            is 13.65 GHz (Ku-band). SSALT is an experimental altimeter (of CNES,
            built by Alcatel Alenia Space, formerly Alcatel Espace, Toulouse) to
            demonstrate the concept of low-power, low-mass, low data rate (1/7 the
            rate of NRA due to extensive on-board processing) and low-cost altimeter
            for future Earth observing missions.

            The TOPEX/Poseidon Microwave Radiometer (TMR) was
            a three-frequency microwave radiometer flown on the
            TOPEX/Poseidon satellite in low Earth orbit that provided
            total water vapor along the path viewed by the altimeter and
            was used for range correction. It measured the brightness
            temperature in the nadir-column at 18, 21, and 37 GHz. The TMR
            monitors and corrects for the propagation path delay of the
            altimeter radar signal due to water vapor and nonprecipitating
            liquid water in the atmosphere. JMR on Jason is a slightly
            more advanced version of TMR.

            NRA was designed and built by JHU/APL, and managed by GSFC. It is the
            prime sensor for the measurement of sea surface heights, wave heights,
            and surface wind speed.
