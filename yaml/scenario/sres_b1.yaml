    name : Special Report on Emissions Scenario B1 Scenario Family
    description : The B1 storyline and scenario family describes a convergent
        world with the same global population, that peaks in mid-century and
        declines thereafter, as in the A1 storyline, but with rapid change in
        economic structures toward a service and information economy, with
        reductions in material intensity and the introduction of clean and
        resource-efficient technologies. The emphasis is on global solutions to
        economic, social and environmental sustainability, including improved
        equity, but without additional climate initiatives.
