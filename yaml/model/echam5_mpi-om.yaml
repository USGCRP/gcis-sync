    description: >
        ECHAM5 is the 5th generation of the ECHAM general circulation model.
        Depending on the configuration the model resolves the atmosphere up to
        10 hPa for tropospheric studies, or up to 0.01 hPa for middle atmosphere
        studies (often referred to as MAECHAM5).
