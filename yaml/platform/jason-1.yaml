        Jason is the name of a joint CNES/NASA oceanography mission
        series with the objective to monitor global ocean circulation,
        discover the tie between the oceans and atmosphere, improve
        global climate predictions, and to monitor events such as El
        NiÃ±o conditions and ocean eddies.

               Positioning Ocean Solid Earth Ice Dynamics Orbiting Navigator
               (Dual frequency solid state radar altimeter)
           description : >
                The Poseidon-2 altimeter is the main instrument on the Jason-1
                mission. Derived from the Poseidon-1 altimeter on TOPEX/Poseidon, it
                measures sea level, wave heights and wind speed. It operates at two
                frequencies and is also able to estimate atmospheric electron content.

            description : >
                 JMR is a JPL instrument of TMR heritage. JMR is a passive microwave
                 radiometer measuring the brightness temperatures in the nadir column
                 at 18.7, 23.8, and 34 GHz, providing path delay correction for the
                 altimeter (the brightness temperatures are converted to path-delay
                 information). The 23.8 GHz channel is the primary water vapor sensor,
                 the 34 GHz channel provides a correction for non-raining clouds, and
                 the 18.7 GHz channel provides the correction for effects of wind-induced
                 enhancements in the sea surface background emission.

            name : BlackJack (GPS Flight Receiver)
            description : >
                BlackJack is also referred to as TRSR-2 (Turbo Rogue Space
                Receiver-2). The instrument is of GPS/MET (Microlab) heritage (of
                a design as flown on CHAMP) and is being provided by NASA/JPL
                and built by Spectrum Astro Inc. of Gilbert, AZ. BlackJack
                is a 16-channel GPS receiver with the objective to provide
                supplementary positioning data to DORIS in support of the POD
                (Precision Orbit Determination) function and to enhance and/or
                improve gravity field models. Radial accuracies of 1-2 cm are
                obtained in post-processing. BlackJack is a fully redundant unit
                (two independent receivers operating in cold redundancy). Each
                unit is comprised of an omnidirectional antenna, low-noise
                amplifier, crystal oscillator, sampling down-converter, and a
                baseband digital processor assembly, communicating through a
                1553 bus interface. Instrument mass = 10 kg (2), power = 17.5 W.
