    description:
        The current incarnation of the GISS series of coupled atmosphere-ocean models is now available. 
        Called ModelE, it provides the ability to simulate many different configurations of Earth System Models - 
        including interactive atmospheric chemistry, aerosols, carbon cycle and other tracers, as well as the standard 
        atmosphere, ocean, sea ice and land surface components.
