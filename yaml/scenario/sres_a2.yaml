    description :
        The A2 storyline and scenario family describes a very heterogeneous
        world. The underlying theme is self-reliance and preservation of local
        identities. Fertility patterns across regions converge very slowly, which
        results in continuously increasing population. Economic development
        is primarily regionally oriented and per capita economic growth and
        technological change more fragmented and slower than other storylines.
