description:
    HadCM3 is a coupled climate model that has been used extensively
    for climate prediction, detection and attribution, and other climate
    sensitivity studies.

    HadCM3 stands for the Hadley Centre Coupled Model version 3. It was
    developed in 1999 and was the first unified model climate configuration
    not to require flux adjustments (artificial adjustments applied to
    climate model simulations to prevent them drifting into unrealistic
    climate states).
