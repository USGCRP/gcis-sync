    description: >
        The new version of the global coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation
        model (MRI-CGCM2), developed at the Meteorological Research Institute
        (MRI), is intended to enable examination of transient future climate
        changes associated with anthropogenic forcings such as the increase of
        greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols. It is important for a climate
        model to be able to reproduce the present climate system realistically,
        including individual physical process components and interactions between
        them. For simulating the transient response of the climate system
        to specific influences, such as the IPCC scenario of an increase in
        greenhouse gases and aerosols, it is necessary for the model to simulate
        adequately not only the mean climate but also its variability.
