    description : >
         TOPEX/Poseidon (or simply T/P) is a cooperative Earth observation mission
         of the USA and France (NASA/JPL and CNES as partners) with the overall
         objective to provide high-accuracy global sea level (ocean height)
         measurements in coordinates relative to the center of the Earth. From
         this information, ocean circulation patterns can be mapped. The T/P data
         analysis helps to understand how the oceans interact with the atmosphere,
         and improve our ability to predict the global climate. NASA provided
         the satellite bus, five instruments, and is responsible for spacecraft
         operations. CNES furnished two of the spacecraft's instruments and the
         mission's Ariane launch vehicle.

                Satellite) is a Doppler satellite tracking system developed
                for precise orbit determination and precise ground location.

            description : >
                This passive sensor of JPL is used by a ground laser network (of 10-15
                SLR stations) to track the position of the satellite for precision orbit
                determination (verification of altitude measurements). The mass of LRA
                is 29 kg; the LRA accuracy depends on laser station characteristics. The
                LRA is used to calibrate the other location systems on the satellite
                (DORIS, GPSDR) with a very high degree of precision.

               (Single frequency solid state radar altimeter)
           description : >
               SSALT is also referred to as Poseidon-1. The single instrument frequency
               is 13.65 GHz (Ku-band). SSALT is an experimental altimeter (of CNES,
               built by Alcatel Alenia Space, formerly Alcatel Espace, Toulouse) to
               demonstrate the concept of low-power, low-mass, low data rate (1/7 the
               rate of NRA due to extensive on-board processing) and low-cost altimeter
               for future Earth observing missions.

            description : >
                The TOPEX/Poseidon microwave radiometer was a three-frequency sensor
                used to estimate the atmospheric water vapor content in the nadir column
                through which the altimeter signal is traveling. Since water vapor
                distorts the altimeter's reading, the water vapor content is measured to
                correct the altimetry measurement. The sensor uses one frequency to make
                the measurement, and two frequencies to remove the effects of wind speed
                and cloud cover. There is a backup receiver for the measurement frequency.

                The dual-frequency NASA radar altimeter, NRA, was the
                primary instrument aboard the spacecraft. It worked by
                sending radio pulses at 13.6 GHz and 5.3 GHz toward the
                earth and measuring the characteristics of the echo. By
                combining this measurement with data from the microwave
                radiometer and with other information from the spacecraft
                and the ground, scientists were able to calculate the
                height of the sea surface to within 4.3 centimeters.
